# 🚀 Speed Typing Test - My Second Project After Learning React

Hey there! 👋 This is my second complete web project, developed after diving into React. I created this interactive typing speed test application to practice and showcase my React skills while building something actually useful for improving typing speed and accuracy.

## 🎯 About This Project

After learning React and getting comfortable with modern frontend development, I wanted to build something more dynamic and interactive than my first project. This typing speed test lets users measure their typing speed, accuracy, and provides real-time feedback with cool sound effects and visual indicators.

## ✨ What I Built

- **🎮 Interactive Typing Test Interface** - Real-time typing test with instant character-by-character feedback
- **📊 Speed & Accuracy Calculation** - Calculates words per minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage
- **🔊 Sound Effects** - Audio feedback for correct and incorrect keystrokes
- **⏱️ Timer Functionality** - Configurable countdown timer for each test
- **📈 Progress Tracking** - Visual progress indicator showing typing completion
- **📱 Responsive Design** - Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **🎨 Modern UI/UX** - Clean, intuitive interface with smooth animations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **⚛️ React** - Component-based UI architecture and state management
- **💻 JavaScript (ES6+)** - Typing logic, calculations, and event handling
- **🎨 CSS3** - Modern styling, animations, and responsive design
- **⚡ Vite** - Fast development server and build tool
- **🌐 HTML5** - Semantic markup and accessibility
